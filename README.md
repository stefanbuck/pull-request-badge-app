# Pull Request Badge App

A few months ago I started working on this GitHub app with the intention to become familiar with the GitHub App and to maybe generate some side income. Since then, the source code remains private because I am unsure whether I should publish it for free or charge for the service.

Recently I came across an interesting experiment by [@calebporzio](https://twitter.com/calebporzio). He was struggling with the same problem but after talking to a friend he came up Sponsorware.

> Sponsorware means building and releasing a project exclusively to people who sponsor you on GitHub, but after reaching a certain number of sponsors, make the package fully open-source and available to anyone.

From the get-go, I was convinced this approach could work for this project as well. Time to talk about the GitHub app.

## What is Pull Request Badge doing?

<a href="https://pullrequestbadge.com/"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1393946/75721049-e781f800-5cd7-11ea-9621-b78c247c511d.png" width="591"></a>

This GitHub App adds badges to your Pull Requests automatically. The root idea was to automatically add a JIRA badge whenever a Pull Request is opened, but it does more than just that. Through the simple API You can easily present any kind of information. For instance you could add a preview badge with a link to a preview.   You could also indicate if the Pull Request is small! Check out [pullrequestbadge.com](https://pullrequestbadge.com/) for more examples and further details. 

## The deal

Once I reach 40 GitHub sponsors, I'll make the source code public. Sponsors will get access to the source code right away. Tiers are starting at $ 5 a month. Check out my sponsor profile https://github.com/sponsors/stefanbuck

## Why should I become a Sponsor?

Access to the source code will allow you to host the app on your own servers. This is primarily beneficial for GitHub Enterprise customers, but maybe you just want to support me in keeping this project alive and with all my other open-source contributions. 

Thank you
